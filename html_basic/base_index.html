        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sam Anuro Omondi and I'm passionate about Software Engineering from Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
        <p>I specialize in building intelligent systems that drive social impact. I'm currently focused on solving urban health challenges using wearable devices, IoT, and machine learning.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the UNâ€™s goals on urbanization, I see technology as a powerful force to improve city life, from healthcare to infrastructure.</p>
        <p>I'm a lifelong learner, constantly exploring new frameworks, languages, and tools. My ideal role is to work as a Machine Learning or Health Tech Software Engineer.</p>
